# responsive
This project is still being worked on, and is not ready to "professional" use, also take into account that this is my first time developing PHP,[...] so it might not be as secure or well optimized as you might need/want. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This is a simple responsive PHP/HTML code, it uses PHP, HTML, CSS and MySQL.

This code is made to work as a simple web"blog", it gives you the possibility to register new users (the purpose is to have more people writing for the "blog"), and post new content.

The layout is responsive to the device resolution, so it should work on a smartphone, and computers without any problems.

#obs. sorry if my english is not adequate.
